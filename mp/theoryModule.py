# MODULE, PACKAGES AND LIBRARIES:

"""
module: it is a file containing python variable and value, statements, functions
we need it for:
organizing our files and purposes
reusing codes
removing conflicts on naming vars
encapsulations : hide underlying complexity, just do the work, don't show user how it is being done
"""


"""
packages: collection of one or more modules
        __init__.py: Makes a normal folder a package, can we left empty or have some code if needed to do anything initially
        without this you can not import it in standard way like:
        import package  
        
"""


"""
libraries: collection of one or more packages and modules
