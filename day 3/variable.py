# # variable are treated as object in python

# # variable rule:
# 1.  A-Z, a-z, _ , numbers: 0-9
# 2. must start from aphabet or underscore
# eg: 
# _name = "salin"
# Name = 'Ram'

# 3. we can not use specials characters/symbol : @!#$%^*()    
# eg:
# # @name = 'salin'
# 4. variable are case sensitive
# name = 'salin'
# print(name)

# Age123 = 27

# print('hello')
